### The meeting and challenge

Everybody has gathered in a big group of hunters at the location of a test to join the expedition.

Flint Shellbreaker, Whispering Snow, and Stalwart Ironslinger are standing on an elevated platform. Flint takes the stage to greet everyone.

Flint explains that they are looking for 3 groups to go to the new island. They have premade groups from all applicants who they think will work well together.

You are put in a waiting room. Stalwart walks in and explains that they are looking for hunters who can overcome a challenge the best way. It is not only about the fastest or strongest hunters. He hand Olin an override core and 2 healing potions.

The hunting party is put in an old mining operation zone. There where 4 watchers and an unidentified machine scrapped together tower in the centre. The party has quickly come up with the plan to let Olin sneak to the centre and activated the tower. The tower overloaded the watchers giving the opportunity to strike. The watchers were quickly taken out.

Whispering Snow takes the party apart to talk about the mission. After the events of Aloyâ€™s victory against HADES an island has started to change form and biomes. Seeing how dangerous HADES was and that the island grow after its defeat, we are worried that someone or something is causing this. We want to know what is happening and by whom.
