## Session Overview 
It's a quiet day on the ocean, one of the first days where not much is going on. Gathered around a bench in the sun the newly formed hunting party takes time to get to know each other. 

[[Bust]] is asked how he got his powers, but he is not sure. He was exploring an ancient ruin and suddenly got this power. Now his power just works, but because he was exploring ruins he got banished from the Nora tribe. He hopes by joining this expedition he can redeem himself.

Next [[Jeb Tetch|Jeb]] tells about his past, how he as a kind got trained to be an assassin. He never finished his training so he never had to do an assassination. His teacher fellow students left to go to the same island, leaving him behind.

[[Pyromas]] tells about how his village was attacked by machines. The village was saved by brave hunters who made a rescue group which [[Pyromas]] joined. Having tasted the thrill of adventure he decided to join the expedition. He uses his staff to enhance his attacks with tech.

Than they got to meet the 9 other hunters exchanging stories and answering questions.

All hunters where gathered in the central room on the boat to discuss the mission and the landing zone. There are the following options:

- Lush Rainforest
- Misty Marshlands
- Rocky Highlands
- Desolate Badlands Canyons
- Grassy Plains
- Frozen Tundra
- Forgotten Ruins

All hunters get a say an share their thoughts. Everybody speaks openly about their thoughts, except for [[Jeb Tetch|Jeb]]. He is sweating and turning a little red. When their is an opening where nobody is talking he loudly speak up and quickly gives his opinion. 

A vote is cast and the chosen location is the Lush Rainforest. Flint states that the other landmarks can later be visited and explored. 

Suddenly all focusses screeches and receives the following message:

*Attention, intruders. You have entered a restricted zone. Turn back immediately. This is your only warning.
Your presence is unauthorized. Continuing forward will result in the activation of defensive protocols.*

Suddenly the boat hits a large object and everybody rushes outside to see what is happening. The boat is under attack by 2 [[Sea Glider|Sea Gliders]] and an [[Azure Titan]]. Using everybody's combat prowess and the 2 ballista's the defeat the machine without much damage.

A new message plays on the focusses:

*Your actions are being monitored. Hostile intent will not be tolerated. Retreat now to avoid escalation.
This is your final opportunity to leave unharmed. Failure to comply will lead to consequences beyond your comprehension.

Taking the [[Azure Titan]] in tow the expedition proceed towards the island.
