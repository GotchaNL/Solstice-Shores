The big group of hunters arrive at the location of the test. Players are not together and dont know each other.

NPC’s are standing on an elevated platform. Flint takes the stage to greet everyone.

He explains that they are looking for 3 groups to go to the new island. They have made groups from all applicants who they think will work well together.

You are put together in a waiting room. Stalwart walks in and explains that they are looking for hunters who can overcome a challenge the best way. It is not only about the fastest or strongest hunters. He gives everybody an override core and 2 healing potions, 2d4 + 2. He will not give any advice.

Time for the party to get to know each other. 

Combat, 4 watchers, disruptor machine in the centre.

Combat finishes.

Flint congratulates the 3 group:

Talanah, the Suntalon
***Level 1 Carja Fighter***
Petra, the Salvagemaster
***Level 1 Oseram Artificer***
Thane Earthcaller
***Level 1 Utaru Sorcerer***

Liana, the Sandstalker
***Level 1 Tenakth Paladin***
Eirik Thundershot
***Level 1 Nora Monk***
Rydan, the Blade Warden
***Level 1 Quen Bard***

Whispering Snow takes the party to talk about the mission. After the events of Aloy’s victory against HADES an island has started to change form and biomes. Seeing how dangerous HADES was and that the island grow after its defeat, we are worried that someone or something is causing this. We want to know what is happening and by whom.

Your task is to set up base on the island, exploring the surroundings, catalogue your findings, and if needed to protect the exploration team. Everybody is given a Focus. Whispering Snow says they will be leaving in a week for the new island.
